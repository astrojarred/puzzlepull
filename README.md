> The Guardian has recently updated the way crosswords are rendered on the site, so the service is currently down. Please see [issue #6](https://github.com/astrojarred/puzzlepull/issues/6) for further info.

This code scrapes and converts crossword puzzles online in HTML format to a [`.ipuz`](http://www.ipuz.org/) format.
This allows the puzzles to be uploaded and solved on sites like [squares.io](http://squares.io/).

You can use the service by visiting [the associated webpage](https://puzzlepull.space.jarred.green).
